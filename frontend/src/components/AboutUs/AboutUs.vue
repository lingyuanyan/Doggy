    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>“Fur Friend Rescue” is one of projects from a non-profit organization called "Little
Masters Club". This organization has been established for more than seven years and
has become a household name in Seattle's Chinese community. The goal of the Little
Master Club is "parents set up the stage, children sing the opera" - that is, the parents
initiate one project and the children are responsible for various duties. The children
would learn and grow through these specific projects, and gradually become the leaders
of the project.
</p>
    <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
    <p>We not only help stray dogs find their forever homes, but also hope that through the
project, the children will learn to respect animals, love animals, learn to communicate
and have a sense of responsibility, so as to achieve our goal of developing and training
children's executive ability and leadership.
</p>
    <h3>Project Goal</h3>
    <p>The stray dogs base of Baoen temple in Shanghai, the organizations that need help to
save stray dogs, and our local adoption agencies in Seattle.</p>
    <h3>Project Exocution</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Let more people know about our “Fur Friend Rescue” project by setting up
  websites and social media pages</li>
      <li>The children will continue to update and maintain our website and webpages</li>
      <li>Work that the children participate in, but the parents are responsible for: the
  adoption family qualification check, phone interviews, inspect the adoption
  families in person and so on.</li>
      <li>The children will follow up on the adoption families in Seattle later on.</li>
      <li>To fundraise at local companies, or raise money for the stray dog shelter base in Shanghai through charity sales and other forms.</li>
      <li>The children will volunteer at local stray dog adoption centers.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Adoption Proccess</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Submit your online application (even if you are not sure which dog you want).
Please note that we will not necessarily give the dogs to the first families to apply, but
are trying to find the most suitable family for them. As we are 100% run by volunteers, it
may take 1-3 working days to process your application. When your initial application is
accepted by us, you will receive our email notification.</li>
      <li>Telephone interview.
We will have a phone interview with the adoption families. This is to further determine
whether the dog is suitable for your family and your lifestyle.
</li>
      <li> In-home inspection
Our volunteers will go to your home to make sure your home environment is suitable for
the dog, and also observe the interaction between your family members and other pets</li>
      <li>Looking for flying volunteers
Once the adoption family is confirmed, volunteers at the Baoen temple will spay/neuter
the dog and start actively looking for flying volunteers.
（Due to the reduction of flights between China and the United States during the
epidemic period, it will take longer to find a flying volunteer. So we will put your dog in a
temporary foster family before we find a flight volunteer. At the same time,the volunteers
will give your dog vaccinations.)
</li>
      <li>At the airport, you will meet your dog for the first time.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cost</h3>
    <p>The stray dogs of Baoen temple in Shanghai not only don't charge, but also pay the cost
of spaying/neutering, vaccine and microchip. They only wish that the stray dogs could
find their forever homes.
The adoption family only pays the cost of the air ticket (currently $200) and the cost of
going out of the customs.</p>
