    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>“Fur Friend Rescue” is one of projects from a non-profit organization called "Little
Masters Club". This organization has been established for more than seven years and
has become a household name in Seattle's Chinese community. The goal of the Little
Master Club is "parents set up the stage, children sing the opera" - that is, the parents
initiate one project and the children are responsible for various duties. The children
would learn and grow through these specific projects, and gradually become the leaders
of the project.
</p>
<h3>Project Objectives</h3>
<p>We not only help stray dogs find their forever homes, but also hope that through the
project, the children will learn to respect animals, love animals, learn to communicate
and have a sense of responsibility, so as to achieve our goal of developing and training
children's executive ability and leadership.

save stray dogs, and our local adoption agencies in Seattle.</p>
